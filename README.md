But you MUST add credits to me or Swayzy


## How To Setup

1. Download the source code, or clone the repository
2. Extract if necessary
3. Open .env file
4. Copy your user id from discord, and paste it in the "MODERATORS" section
5. Add your discord bot token
6. Download mongodb community server (MUST BE THAT VERSION)
7. Make a new connection, and enter the text from "MONGODB_DATABASE" in the URI
8. To make the backend work you have to go to the file setup.bat and run it
9. Finally run the start.bat command to start your backend!

Extra Step,
If you wanna remove all traces of ember ingame. Edit the DefaultGame.ini, and replace all the text containing ember, and either replace it or remove it

## Bugs

If you notice any issues with the backend, please make a new issue.
